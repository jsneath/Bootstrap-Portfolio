# James-Portfolio-Improved

## Introduction

This website was built as part of a challenge to show off my current web portfolio. 
This was a remake of my original portfolio where i had the opportunity to practice with bootstrap. I also made my page slightly more dynamic with CSS hover attributes over the cards. 

I only have 1 website available as part of my portfolio so i've had to use github links to the remaining projects. 

## Features

Personal Introduction: Upon loading, the page displays my name, a recent photo, and links to various sections about me, my work, skills and contact information.

Navigation: Clicking on any navigation link scrolls you to the corresponding section, enhancing user experience.

Portfolio Showcase: The 'Work' section flaunts images of my projects. Although some might be placeholders for now, they will be replaced with real applications as I continue my journey. As you hover over the image, you will see more information on the project
